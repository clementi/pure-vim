# Pure language support for Vim

A simple Vim mode for the [Pure programming language](https://agraef.github.io/pure-lang/). It provides syntax highlighting only.

This script comes from the downloads at https://agraef.github.io/pure-lang/.

## Installation

Use a plugin manager for Vim, such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

With vim-plug, put the following line in your `~/.vimrc` between your calls to `plug#begin()` and `plug#end()`:

```vim
Plug 'clementi/pure-vim'
```
